    Dave is a cool administrator, this file gets screwed up when
    /mysite/templates/admin/index.html
    is running so I changed the name of index.html to fucksShitUpOldIndex.html
    or something like that so it doesn't get accessed.  It looks like
    this file is the index now for the overall administration.
    myPolls has its own admin and is tagged on underneath this one.
